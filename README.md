Software Engineer
----------------------------

Colburn is a builder at heart, and dares you to resize your browser. I dream in JavaScript. React (Nodejs) takes me on adventures. 
No FTP, bruh. Continuous integration makes the world a better place. 
I usually love the latest things. Internet Explorer, amirite? I like people, I'm no extrovert, but I work well with others on the team and can communicate to clients.
