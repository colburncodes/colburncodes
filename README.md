Software Engineer
----------------------------

Colburn is a builder at heart, and dares you to resize your browser. He dreams in JavaScript. React (Nodejs) takes him on adventures. C# keeps him busy during the day.
No FTP, bruh. Continuous integration makes the world a better place. 
He usually loves the latest things. Internet Explorer, amirite? He likes people, he's no extrovert, but he works well with others on the team and can communicate to clients.
